              <p>REST is an architectural style for distributed systems. However, many implementations forget about the distributed part of REST and simply map CRUD operations to HTTP verbs in a monolithic application. Hey, we want more!

While building both services and a consuming client we can discuss the sweet things about component-oriented architectures and french beer.</p>

            <span class="summary">
              <p>Computers are being built with more and more CPUs and those CPUs in turn have several cores. Powerful calculations are now performed either on many-cored machines, or on distributed systems. In this context, it's in the developer's interest to start thinking about concurrent programming. But concurrent programming with mutable is tricky. The last few years have conclusively shown that very few developers get this right when faced with conventional shared state threads.</p>
              <p>One of the ways to simplify concurrent programming is the actor model. In the actor model, programs are made of actors sending each other messages, and acting on the messages they receive. The actors don't share any state.</p>
              <p>In this talk I explore several ways to implement the actor model in Ruby.</p>
              <p>The existing actor implementations in Ruby:
              <dl>
                <dd>- Rubinius actors</dd>
                <dd>- Existing actor gems (cross Ruby implementations)</dd>
              </dl>
              </p>
              <p>Actor implementations that are a little more 'out there':
              <dl>
                <dd>- Bindings with the Akka framework in Scala with JRuby</dd>
                <dd>- Bindings with erlang, the first mainstream implementation of the actor model</dd>
                <dd>- And their advantages and drawbacks, and code examples.</dd>
              <dl>
              </p>
              <p>The talk will also allude to the fact that threads in Ruby should ideally have separate state, so that all programs using threads could also use the actor model (or other similar concurrency models).</p>
